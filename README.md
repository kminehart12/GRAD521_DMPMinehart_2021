Contents of the project for this DMP:

My proposed research attempts to predict ecological regime shifts in Pacific Northwest protected areas through statistical modeling and spatial analysis. Using open source tools including R, Python, and QGIS, this work seeks to understand and quantify climate change impacts on protected areas, which serve as vital reservoirs of scientific, cultural, educational, and spiritual importance. Ideally, this work will inform future management of these areas in order to achieve a more resilient future for ecosystems and human systems alike.

Specifically, my research seeks to understand ecological regime shifts in Pacific Northwest protected areas driven by wildfires attributed to climate change. In order to address this question, I will use publicly available data from the National Land Cover Dataset will be the focus of my Data Management Plan.

The data that I plan to use for this project includes the following:

National Land Cover Dataset raster files (.tif) for 2001, 2006, 2011, and 2016
The National Land Cover Database (NLCD) provides consistent land cover data products for all 50 US States. Created and managed by several federal agencies, the dataset is publicly available to all users to ask and answer questions and land use and cover change nationally. The data is derived from publicly available Landsat satellite imagery and is updated every 4-5 years. Consequently, this data is observational in nature. 

The NLCD contains data over 4 time periods, 2001 , 2006, 2011, and 2016. This data is freely available in raster (.tif)  format for download on the NLCD website. Once downloaded, this data should be stored for analysis on a SSD and backed up in zipped files in the cloud and on an external hard drive. A spatial analysis software, like QGIS (GRASS plugin,) ENVI, or ArcGIS is needed to view, analyze, and  interpret this data.

Each national dataset is in raster (.tif) format and ranges from 1 - 2 GB in size for the entire 50-state area. The subset of data that I am interested in (Oregon, Washington, and Idaho) will be ~200 MB in size for each year, so all 4 years will equate to approximately 1GB of data.
