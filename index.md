# Data Description
My proposed research attempts to predict ecological regime shifts in Pacific Northwest protected areas through statistical modeling and spatial analysis. Using open source tools including R, Python, and QGIS, this work seeks to understand and quantify climate change impacts on protected areas, which serve as vital reservoirs of scientific, cultural, educational, and spiritual importance. Ideally, this work will inform future management of these areas in order to achieve a more resilient future for ecosystems and human systems alike.
Specifically, my research seeks to understand ecological regime shifts in Pacific Northwest protected areas driven by wildfires attributed to climate change. In order to address this question, I will use publicly available data from the National Land Cover Dataset will be the focus of my Data Management Plan.

Terms of Use:
This dataset is under the U.S. public domain. As a product of the US government and representative of factual information (land cover and vegetation type), this work is copy-right free and available for public use/reuse.

# Roles and responsibilities
This question is challenging as I haven’t worked on a specific project with my lab yet so I’m not sure where to start. I suspect our lead PI and faculty is responsible for implementing the DMP but other PIs (post-doc students) are responsible for this as well. Of course, student researchers also have an obligation to promote and adhere to policies of the DMP. If someone from our lab left, the data would remain at OSU.

# Data standards and metadata
The data I plan to use for my research is publicly available, open source non-copyright information on environmental variables. Consequently, I do not need to protected it - it can be shared publicly. 

However, when using publicly available spatial data, it is imperative to keep track of the metadata file and update it with any relevant copyright information.

# Storage and security
My main workstation is my home office, which is where my working data is stored. I will also have data backed up on the cloud as well as on hard drives.
As noted above, I will have three copies of my data at all times. Many of the processes I will use are both manual and automatic as I build and run ecological models. To do this, I will use R and Python languages and spatial analysis software including QGIS, ArcGIS, Google Earth Engine, and ENVI. 

# Access and data sharing
My data (once I begin actual research) will be shared with my lab members and PI via GitHub.

# Archiving and preservation
My data will remain accessable to the public via Github after I leave OSU.
